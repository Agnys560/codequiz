In this project I worked alongside my classmates/tablemates to help achieve and get certain things to work.
I went onto vacation for my brothers wedding as I could not miss his weddings, its his wedding. So the amount of work I have inputted into this homework is not nearly as much as I would obviously like to have had as I had absolutely no time at all to work on this sadly, even with me rushing all the events I did not have time over the trip. So I could not include a timer or a highscore sadly but I do believe I managed to get the quiz part of the homework to work. I am going to try to implement the aspects not included within the next day or two and hope I can do a resubmit if the TA's allow me to.
